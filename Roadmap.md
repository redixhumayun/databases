#   Next Steps For Implementation

- [X] When inserting a new record into a node, don't generate a tx_id from the WAL. Instead, the tx_id should be generated by the client and passed in as a parameter to the insert method. This will allow the client to generate a tx_id that is unique across all nodes in the cluster. The WAL can then be used to store the tx_id

- [X] When inserting a new record, check whether the page it will be inserted into has a valid free block list. If it does, use the last free block in the list and update the free block list accordingly. If it does not, call the relevant method to get a new memory region to use.

- [] Ensure that the WAL records inserted into the WAL log meet the Postgresql file format for a WAL

- [] Implement a row level locking mechanism when dealing with row updates and deletes. Right now there is a global lock on the entire table when a row is updated or deleted.
